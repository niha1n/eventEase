## üîÑ Application Flow

### 1. Authentication Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Visit] --> B{Has Session?}
    B -->|No| C[Login/Signup]
    B -->|Yes| D[Role Check]
    C --> E[Authentication]
    E --> F{Valid Credentials?}
    F -->|Yes| D
    F -->|No| C
    D --> G[Admin Dashboard]
    D --> H[Staff Dashboard]
    D --> I[Event Manager Dashboard]
```

### 2. Event Management Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Create Event] --> B[Set Basic Info]
    B --> C[Add Custom Fields]
    C --> D[Set RSVP Options]
    D --> E[Preview Event]
    E --> F{Publish?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Live Event]
    F -->|No| H[Draft]
    G --> I[Track RSVPs]
    I --> J[Analytics]
```
